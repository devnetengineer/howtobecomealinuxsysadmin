LDAP
-Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
-LDAP is a lightweight protocol for accessing directory services, specifically x.500-based directory services
-LDAP runs over TCP/IP or other connecton oriented transfer services


***************************************
What is a directory?
-a directory is a specialized database optimized for reading, browsing, and searching
-directories tend to contain "descriptive, attribute-based information" and support sophisticated filtering capabilities 

***************************************
Local vs. Global

Local directory service
-provides services to a restricted content

Global directory service
-provides services to a much broader context
-global services are usually distributed, meaning the data they contain is spread across many machines 
EX) DNS servers are an example of a globally distributed directory services

***************************************

What kind of information can be stored in the directory?
-LDAP information model is based on "entries":

An entry = a collectin of attributes that has a globally-unique Distinguished Name (DN)

*A "DN" is used to refer to the "entry" unambiguously

Each entry's attributes has a "type" and one or more "values":

ca = common name
mail = email address

*the syntax of values depend on the attribute type:

cn = Bob Smith
mail = bob@example.com
jpegPhoto = a JPEG (binary) format/photo

****************************************

How is the information arranged?
-in LDAP, directories entries are arranged in a hierarchical tree-like structure
-traditionally, the tree-like hierarchical structure reflected the geographic and/or organization boundaries
EX)

c = GB > 
c = US > 
st = Cali > 
o = Acme (the organization) > 
ou = Marketing (organizational unit) >
cn = Bob Smith (person)


-the tree may also be arranged based upon Internet domain names
EX)

dc = net >
dc = com >
dc = example (the organization) >
ou = servers or people (organizational unit) >
uid = babs (person)
