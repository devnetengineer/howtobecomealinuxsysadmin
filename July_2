After many tries to get the spacewalk to install correctly on CentOS8, I have finally re-imaged the server with CentOS7 due to more How To guides and relavent information
out there.

*It does seem that Spacewalk is not the most popular choice for type 1 Hypervisor (not anymore at least)

update

I was able to install KVM and Spacewalk following this guide:

https://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/how-to-install-spacewalk-on-centos-7-rhel-7.html

One thing that is necessary is to change the hostname since the Spacewalk server is installed on the kvm itself:

/etc/sysconfig/network
/etc/hosts
/etc/hostname

You can all edit them manually but you can use the hostnamectl command to set it for
/etc/hostname:

hostnamectl set-hostname spacewalk.beanstalk.com

tried doing /etc/init.d/network restart but had to reboot to
get it to show up in the environment variable




Unfortunately I am not able to pull the GUI using the command:
virt-manager

Getting the error of:
(virt-manager:7773): Gtk-WARNING **: 13:07:16:038: cannot open display:

**********
It seems like in order for me to ssh into the servers, I need to set up a bridge on the hypervisor so I can connect to the VMs in the future
