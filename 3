Set up dhcpd service for the entire environment

dhcp daemon --> SpaceWalk (pxeboot machine)

*There are a lot of moving parts to imaging devices using one of the tools mentioned above, and there can be a
lot of pain points in the process.  When you are trying to image a device youare usually trying to interact with it 
before the pre-installed Operating System (OS) launches or interact it when it doesn’t have an OS installed on it.  
And to do that we want to interact with the Preboot Execution Environment or PXE as its commonly referred to. And 
this is often the part that can cause a lot of pain.

 

The PXE environment in its simplest form is the process of having your device boot from its network card.  For 
the device to boot into the PXE environment it needs to receive the relevant instructions.  The most common way 
of trying to do this is to configure your Dynamic Host Configuration (DHCP) server to store and serve this information.

PXE Boot Process

 

Using your DHCP server to store and serve this information looks like this:

The device sends out a DHCP broadcast and states that it needs to PXE boot (you’ve often initiated this request 
by hitting F12 on the device as it starts up)
The DHCP server picks up this broadcast and replies with a suggested IP address to use. If the server has the information 
on how to PXE boot, that information is included in its reply
The device then replies to the server and uses the provided address
Then the device contacts the PXE boot server (traditional a WDS server or SCCM server) and requests the boot file 
(also known as the Network Boot Program (NBP)) that it was told to look for from the DHCP server
The file is then loaded and launched on the client

Setting this up will allow you use Cobbler to do unattended OS installations
*make sure every FORWARD ZONE you create has a REVERSE ZONE associated with it
ex) internal.virtnet, not .local
