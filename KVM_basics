Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)
-a loadable Kernel module that turns Linux into a Type 1 (bare-metal) hypervisor that creates a virtual operating platforms
used to run virtual machines
-supports "nested virtualization", which allows you to run a VM inside another VM
-provides enhanced VM security such as: SELinux and sVirt
-supports both offline and realtime migration: migration of running VM between physical hosts


Under KVM
-each VM is a Linux process that is scheduled and managed by the kernel and has private virtualized hardware such as: CPU, network
card, and etc
-inherits kernel memory management features from Linux style OS
