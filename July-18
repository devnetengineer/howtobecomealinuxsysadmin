A lot of times has passed by, part of it was due to studying for RHCSA.

Today's objective is to learn more about KVM

The main topic today is NETWORKING and STORAGE

Bridge is a virtual switch used by libvirt
TAP == layer 2 frames travel here
TUN == layer 3 packets travel here 

Before we can configure a bridge on our hypervisor, we need to see if the bridge module is loaded into the kernel:


lsmod | grep "bridge"

[root@spacewalk ~]# lsmod | grep bridge
bridge                192512  0
stp                    16384  1 bridge
llc                    16384  2 bridge,stp


According to https://access.redhat.com/documentation ... ctionality , bridge-utils was deprecated in 7.7 .

It may be just easier to use nmcli/nmtui to configure the bridge
