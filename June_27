The assembly of parts took about 3-4 hours

Ran into some trouble when trying to put the CenOS8 iso image on the USB:
-used  software called Etcher to take the downloaded iso image to "flash" it into the USB drive
to make it a bootable USB drive that the new server can boot from
-after the "flash" was completed, although I could audibly tell the USB drive was connected 
(Windows makes a sound when a new device is connected), I could not see the actual USB drive
icon
-looking thorugh their forums, it seems that the software had issues in the past where it bricked
a lot of the USB drives after the "flash" by either rendering them completely useless to the
point of no return or reducing the storage size of the USB drive
-fortunately, it seemed that my USB drive was not bricked because from some of the posts on
the forum, it's because once it's "flashed", Windows cannot detect a Linux image, just the boot partition (even though
in the past, I could still see the bootable USB drive and the content of the image. Used
Rufus or some other software though)

Connected the USB drive to the new server and booted the server, fingers crossed

There was a good 15 seconds of nothing-ness then it booted, and it booted straight into the USB drive without me having to change the boot order

During the installation of the CentOS8, I went ahead and connected an Ethernet cable so I could get all the necessary modules and libraries during the 
installation setup. Also this enabled the NTP and it automatically adjusted the clock on the system

Debated which "software selection" to choose from but from researching, I decided to choose "Minimal Install" since this kernel will be a KVM host that will 
host many VMs, plus I can always add any option from the command line, including any GUI features

Installation was a lot quicker than what I have had in the past, on the laptop/etc

No users configured, just the root

After the reboot, I noticed there were two kernels. Both of them said Centos8 Linux but one of them had the keyword "rescue"

After some researching, it seems like that kernel serves as basically a Recovery Mode where in case the regular kernel is corrupted, you can pull
and backup the data through the Rescue kernel
