Decided to change up the plan, again.

After having issues such as:
-not being able to pull virt-manager on the server
-not understanding bridge-d virtual -networking and how it works in relation to the Home network/router/dhcp/etc

Feeling pretty useless but I did a quick test and was able to ssh into the service on my desktop(work). Just needed to add this config:

yum -y install openssh-server openssh-clients

systemctl enable sshd.service
systemctl start sshd.service

*if you want to check if port 22 is open:

ss -tulpn | grep ':22'

If closed, just open it:

firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=ssh --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

you can customize your SSH config:

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

just to confirm, our home router is doing the routing/switching from our desktop (work) to the server and they are both independently connected to the router via Cat5E Ethernet
cords
