SELinux
-Security-Enhanced Linux
-a security architecture for Linux systems that allows administrators to have more control over
who can access the system
*it was originally developed by the NSA as a series of patches to the Linux kernel using Linux Security Modules (LSM)




How does it work?
-SELinux defines access controls for the applications, processes, and files on a system
-uses security policies, which are a set of rules that tell SELinux what can or cannot be
accessed, to enforce the access allowed by a policy

-when a subject (whether it may be a process or an application) makes a request to access an object,
like a file, SELinux checks with an access vector cache (AVC), where permissions are cached for 
subjects and objects

-if SELinux is unable to make a decision about access based on the cached permissions, it sends
the request to the security server. The security server checks for the security context of the
application or a procession and the file
*Security context is applied from the SELinux policy database. Permission is then granted or denied

*If denied, the following message will be found in /var/log.messages:
"avc:denied"





How to configure SELinux
-while there are a number of ways to configure SELinux, the most common are targeted policy or
multi-level security (MLS)
-targeted policy is the default option and covers a range of processes, tasks, and services
-MLS can be very complicated and is typically only used by government organization

-check here to see what the system is supposed to be running:
/etc/sysconfig/selinux




SELinux labeling and type enforcement
*type enforcement and labeling are the most important concepts for SELinux
-SELinux works as a labeling system: all of the files, processes, and ports in a system have an
SELinux label associated with them
-labels are a logical way of grouping things together
-kernel manages the labels during boot
-label format:

user:role:type:level (level is optional)

-SELinux uses type enforcement to enforce a policy that is defined on the system
-type enforcement is the part of an SELinux policy that defines whether a process running with a 
certain type can access a file labeled with a certain type




Enabling SELinux
-can you enable SELinux by editing /etc/selinux/config
*if you are enabling SELinux, you need to force the system to automatically relabel the filesystem
by creating an empty file named '.autorelabel' in the root directory and then rebooting
*you can manually edit the /etc/selinux/config or /etc/sysconfig/selinux or just run 'setenforce 1'



/etc/sysconfig/selinux vs. /etc/selinux/config


The /etc/sysconfig/selinux contains a symbolic link to the actual configuration file, /etc/selinux/config.


ENFORCING
-SELinux security policy is enforced

PERMISSIVE
-SELinux system prints warnings but does not enforce policy. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting
purposes
-in permissive mode, more denials will be LOGGED , as subject will be able to continue with actions
otherwise denied in enforce mode

DISABLED
-SELinux is fully disabled
-SELinux hooks are disengaged from the kernel and the pseudo-file system is unregistered
