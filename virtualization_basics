Hypervisor, in its generic definition, is a virtualiation technology that allows you to host multiple virtual instances of Operating Systems
on a physical hardware, such as a dedicated server.

Hypervisor has two types: Type 1 and Type 2.

If you have installed VirtualBox on your Windows machine and created VMs, you have used what it's considered as Type 2 hypervisor. This type
of hypervisor resides on top of another OS, and tends to be not as efficient in terms of utilizing the hardware resources as the Type 1
hypervisor due to have an OS as the middleman, between the hypervisor and the hardware.

Mostly in enterprise settings, you will see Type 1 hypervisors. These hypervisors reside directly on top of the hardware and tend to be
a lot more efficient in distributing the resources between the VMs.

Two examples of Type 1 hypervisor are: ESXi hypervisor from VMware and the Open Source KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine).

ESXi hypervisor is managed through the VMware's proprietary management platform (vSphere). It seems to be more user friendly than KVMs, but
like most things "user-friend" in Information Technology world, they are not as lightweight as the Open Source Linux based applications
and Operating Systems. 

On the other hand, KVM is able to run applications at its near-native speeds, faster than other industry hypervisors. It's also capable of
integrating with your existing infrastructure and many different Linux and Windows platforms.
