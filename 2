2: Managing Channels and Repositories in Spacewalk

*Channel is nothing but a collection of software (RPM) packages. A channel may contain packages from a specific 
distribution or contains packages for an application or family of applications. Users may also define channels.

Any client can subscribe to a particular channel to download, update, install packages. The channels are linked to 
upstream server (a normal YUM/DEB repository). A channel may have linked to multiple repositories, can be cloned, sync or customized.

There are two types of channels:

Base channels
Child channels
A base channel consists of packages based on a specific architecture and Red Hat Enterprise Linux release. 
A child channel is a channel associated with a base channel that contains extra packages. 
A system must be subscribed to only one base channel but it can be subscribed to multiple child channels of its base channel.

A subscribed system can only install or update packages available through its Satellite channels.
