How is the information referenced?
-an entry is referenced by its DN (distinguished name), which is constructed by taking the name of the entry itself:
RDN (Relative Distinguished Name) and concatenating the name of its ancestor entries


EX) 
Bob Smith
RDN: uid=babs
DN: uid=babs, ou = People, dc = example, dc = com

How is the information accessed?
-LDAP defines the operations for interrogating and updating the directory
*Mostly, LDAP is used to search for information in the directory

**************************************************
How does LDAP work?
-LDAP directory service is based on a "client-server" model
-one or more  LDAP servers contain the data making up the Directory Information Tree (DIT)
EX)
1. the client connects to servers and ask a question
2. the server responds with an answer and/or point to where the client can get additional information
CLIENT <----------------> LDAP server

**************************************************
X.500
-X.500's Directory Access Protocol (DAP) is a heavyweight protocol that operates over a full OSI protocol stack
*requires a significant more computing resources

-LDAP is designed to operate over TCP/IP and provide most of the functionality of DAP at a much lower cost

CLIENT ----(LDAP)-------> (GATEWAY)-------(DAP)----->X.500 server
*while LDAP is still used to access X.500 directory service via gateways, LDAP is now more commonly directly implemented in X.500 servers
