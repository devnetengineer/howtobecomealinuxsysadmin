Have set up a Minimal Install of Centos8 with nothing else installed on the server. Currently there's:

Root
Jyoo

Jyoo has Admin privileges. Currently SSHing from the desktop(work) to the server on 192.168.1.67

********************************************************************************************************
Currently the server, despite being freshly re-deployed, has the hostname of Spacewalk. It seems like the name was assigned
by the router since most likely the Soho router at home has DNS capabilities

To check to see if it supports virtualization:

grep 'svm' /proc/cpuinfo (since it's AMD processor, we will use 'svm'. If it was Intel, it would be 'vmx')

To verify whether the modules are loaded or not for kvm:

[jyoo@spacewalk ~]$ lsmod | grep kvm
kvm                   786432  0
irqbypass              16384  1 kvm

*If not loaded, it can be loaded from BIOS

*******
CORE
For the most part, one core per vCPU is recommended. 
Overcomitting (assigning more virtual resources than the physical resources available) is appropriate if the virtual machines
will not be running CPU-intensive tasks\

PHYSICAL MEMORY (RAM)
always leave at least 2 GB of RAM for the hypervisor (for systems with RAM upto 64 GB)

STORAGE
things to consider:
1. space required for the OS installation
2. SWAP
3. virtual machine disk usage

for most uses, 2 GB of swap space for systems with 4 GB of RAM or less

NETWORK
One NIC with a bandwidth of at least 1 GBps is recommended
*it is suggested to bind multiple network interfaces together into a single channel using Linux bonding technology and build
virtual machine network infrastructure on top of it.

Installing virtualization packages

The minimum required packages for setting up a virtualization environment are:
1. libvirt
2. qemu-kvm
3. virt-manager

yum install qemu-kvm libvirt virt-install virt-manager virt-install -y

****************
after installing the KVM virtualization packages, the first thing you should do is start a libvirt service

As soon as you start the libvirt service, it will expose a rich Application Programmable Interface (API) to interact with
qemu-kvm binary

*Qemu-kvm binary- clients such as virsh and virt-manager use this API to talk with qemu-kvm for virtual machine life cycle 
management:

********************
Before creating virtual machines, it is very important to validate the system and make sure it meets all the
prerequisites to be a KVM virtualization host. And also undersatnd what the virt capabilities are

1. virt-host-validate
-this command ran as Root will perform sanity checks on KVM capabilities to validate that the host is configured in a suitable 
way to run the libvirt hypervisor drivers using KVM virtualization
EX)
if a server has all the necessary packages required for KVM virtualization but lacks the hardware virtualization support,
this command will give you an output that warns you of such issue

Which parameters are checked by "virt-host-validate"?
-/dev/kvm
The KVM drivers create a /dev/kvm character device on the host to facilitate direct hardware access for virtual machines
*Not having this devices means that the VMs won't be able to access physical hardware, although it's enabled in the BIOS. Also
this can reduce the VMs' performance significantly
-/dev/vhost-net
The vhost-net driver creates a /dev/vhost-net character devices on the host, which will serve as the interface to configure
the vhost-net instance
*Not having this device significantly reduces the virtual machine's network performances
-/dev/net/tun
This is another character special device used for creating tun/tap devices to facilitate network connectivity for a 
virtual machine
